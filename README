* About this library

	This is a simple logging library although I have not written any parts
	of it yet.

	Intended readers of the log are developers.

	* This library is under construction.

* Motivation

	I want to write a logging library which is easy enough to write
	logging code.

	It is often difficult for me to write logging code.
	
	I often think I will add logging code later after implementing
	necessary features. But then after testing is done, I often think
	I do not want to add logging code because testing have already
	been done.

	I think this is not good habit.

	I am not sure whether I can create it or not. But I hit upon an idea,
	so I try it.
