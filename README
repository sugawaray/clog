* ABOUT THIS LIBRARY

This is a simple logging library for C++.

Its main feature is that it enables to call a logging function and a normal
function at the same time.

This simplifies code which needs to output logs for several events.

For example, when you write code which use databases ...

	if (opendb(..., ...) == 0) {
		LOG("opened a db connection");
		if (getsomedata(v, ...) != 0) {
			LOG("failed to get some data");
			...
		}
		if (closedb(...) != 0) {
			LOG("failed to close a db connection.");
			...
		} else {
			LOG("db connection is closed.");
		}
	} else {
		...
		LOG("failed to open a db connection");
		...
	}

Using this library, the example above can be simplified like below(or will
be able to be simplified because implementation has not completed yet.).

	if (L2(Eopendb, opendb, ..., ...) == 0) {
		if (L2(Egetsomedata, getsomedata, v, ...) != 0) {
			...
		}
		if (L1(closedb(Eclosedb, ...) != 0) {
			...
		}
	}

Intended readers of the log are developers.

* This library is under construction and its API changes frequently.
